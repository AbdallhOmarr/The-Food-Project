# The-Food-Project

This is a web app project doing using Python, Django, Javascript, HTML, CSS. 
I'm doing this project to practice on how to make good API 
I want to first try to figure myself the problem faced during the code process 
then I will learn how to build an API from a good learning resource

I find this way of learning is very efficient for me to understand deeply the concepts and problems in any topic



## description of the project 

This web app to enable people at work to order food together without knowing each other
this will save time in many aspects such as the time to decide and talk to another colleges to find which restaurant they will order from
